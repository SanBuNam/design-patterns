     MVC Pattern
     Model-view-controller(MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three inter-connected parts.
     This is done to separate internal representatioons of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
     The MVC design pattern decouples the major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.
